# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

# About the Project:

This project aims to predict the likelihood of bank customers churning. The dataset includes various customer attributes (e.g., credit score, age, balance, number of products, etc.), and the goal is to determine the probability of a customer leaving the bank (0 or 1). By utilizing the CatBoost algorithm, this project achieves a high-accuracy prediction model.
